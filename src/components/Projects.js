                    <p>infinite worlds is a side scrolling platformer game, similar to those we grew up with from the mid 1990's. built using phaser.js, this project was exceptionally challenging. As a team we worked together to make this idea come to life. splitting the project into four parts I was in charge of creating and designing the scenes before and after the main game, these are the title scene, loading screen, controller scene, game over, and credit scenes.</p>
