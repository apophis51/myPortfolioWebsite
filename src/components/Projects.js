                    <p>infinite worlds is a side scrolling platformer game, similar to those we grew up with from the mid 1990's. built using phaser.js, this project was exceptionally challenging. As a team we worked together to make this idea come to life. splitting the project into four parts I was in charge of creating and designing the scenes before and after the main game, these are the title scene, loading screen, controller scene, game over, and credit scenes.</p>

                    <p>"gracebuster" is a fullstack e-commerce site, this was a project done while attending Fullstack Academy, titled the "gracehopper project". In our version of the site, we allow users to pick their favorite classic moview, add them to their cart or guest cart and checkout. Working with three other software engineering students, I was tasked with the front-end development, this includes file structuring, routing, component creation, and styling. Built in React.js and CSS to utilize reusable components and screen responsiveness respectively. </p>
